"""qLib VEXpressions for existing Houdini nodes."""

Many Houdini nodes support VEXpressions where you can use VEX snippets to
extend certain aspects of a node's functionality.

qLib provides extra convenience VEXpression presets for quite a few built-in
nodes.

For the full list, see the [VEXpressions file|/VEXpressions.txt].
